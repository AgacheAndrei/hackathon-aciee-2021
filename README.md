## Problem
Creating a hardware-software system to control the movement of a "pan & tilt" system with an attached video cameraüé• in order to track an object (a ping-pong ball üèì) within the area of interest.
## Solution
### Hardware development
1. I have cut the axes for the camera mount.
2. I have installed the servo motors that provide mobility.
3. Connecting the servo-motors to the Raspberry Pi board.
4. Mounting the camera on the holder.

### Sofware development
1. Developing the code for controlling the servo motors' movement. 
   <pre>
     Library: RPI.GPIO 
     Setting the initial position: 90¬∞x-90¬∞y 
     Moving the servos based on the object's position 
     Tracking the object within given parameters (500x500)

   </pre>

2. Developing the code for object motion detection.
   <pre>
     Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Collections, Imutils, argparse, time
     Detection of object color range
     Image processing for efficient object detection
     Object detection based on color and shape
     Displaying the object's trajectory and its position graphically
     **For the video demo go to -> demo_software.gif
     **For the video demo where the system of tracking the trajectory can be seen better go to -> demo_software_2.mp4
   </pre>
3. Integration of codes for simultaneous execution of functions.
   <pre>
    Real-time detection of the ball using the Raspberry Pi camera and tracking it with the Pan Tilt assembly.
